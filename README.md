# Monke_game
This is a chimp test i developed after seeing this video "https://youtu.be/zsXP8qeFF6A" without even knowing the test's name or anything and i decided to develop it and play the game myself to test if it's really that hard, it wasn't and i beat the game almost everytime.
I built it using mainly tkinter and added some statistic features. 
Feel free to play it and test your memory! :D
